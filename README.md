# Sequence Game Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to create simulations of the game [Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_(game))
in order to gain a better understanding of the optimal playing patterns.

This repository is written using the python language and does not implement optimal algorithms
but rather gets the job done well enough so that an understanding of the game can be made.

## Running the code

The [uv Package Manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is used to maintain this repository.

A `Makefile` is also present within this repository to help with set-up, maintenance and running
of the code.
